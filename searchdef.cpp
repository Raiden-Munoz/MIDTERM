searching algorith:
algorithm made up of a series of instructions that retrieves information
stored within some data structure, or calculated 
in the search space of a problem domain

linear search:
for finding a target value within a list of values.
it sequentially checks each element of the list 
for the target value until a match is found or
until all the elements have been searched.

binary search:
the most popular. it is efficient and also one of the 
most commonly used techniques that is used to solve 
problems. binary search use sorted array by repeatedly
dividing the search interval in half

jump search:
for sorted arrays. the basic idea is to check fewer
elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by 
fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of
searching all elements

interpolation search:
an imporvement over binary search for instances. on the other
hand interpolation seach may go to different locations
according the value of key being searched.
