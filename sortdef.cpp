sorting algorithms;
an algorith made up of a series of insturctions that takes
an array as input, and outputs a sorted array 

merge sort:
a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique
with worst case time complexity of O(nlogn), it is one of the most respected
algorithms

it first divides the array into equel halves and then combines them in a sorted
manner

bubble sort:
simpliest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements
if they are in the wrong order

selection sort:
sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning

insertion sort:
a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards
in our hands
